OpenAL bindings for Go, which works well with windows platform
====================================

I've forked this library from https://github.com/phf/go-openal 
and have started changing it quite a bit from the original library.

I don't have any experience with the original OpenAl libraries.
In this repo, I edited some of the code to support windows platform. Plz notice it contains openal 1.2 version.


To install simply install the openal and alc libs appropriately for
your platform, or build them from scratch, then run

go get -u github.com/dextercai/go-openal/
